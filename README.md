# Portfolio transformation
This repo is involved in the 3rd iteration of my portfolio website. 
It runs a modern web stack of ReactJS, Rails API and Active Admin CMS

I built my portfolio based on this web stack because I have the power of ReactJS dynamic layout in the front end, the light and powerful backend logic Rails API and the flexibility to CRUD with Active Admin CMS.

## Tech Stack:
Front End
- ReactJS
- React Router
- Semantic UI

Back End
- Rails API mode
- ActiveAdmin
- Devise

## TODO
- ~~Finish up pages~~
- ~~Setup Blog access~~
